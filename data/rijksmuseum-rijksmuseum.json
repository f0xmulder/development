    "description": "The live website API (which has a live link to the website platform) makes the full power of the award-winning Rijksmuseum website directly accessible to developers. Searching the collection through the API offers a wide range of interesting possibilities, as do features such as the “explore the collection” pages, the Rijksstudio users’ collections, and the tiled images used to zoom in to close-ups of works of art. Other kinds of data are also available, such as information from the Rijksmuseum’s events calendar. The JSON-based service is so easy to use that you can create an application using the Rijksmuseum’s rich and freely accessible content in no time.",
