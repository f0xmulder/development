From development to production
==============================

# Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `master`. Use the format `feature/<issue-number>-descriptive-name>`
1. Make your changes and push to the origin
1. Once the CI job has succeeded, ask for a review.
1. Once the review has been completed and the discussions resolved, merge to `master`
